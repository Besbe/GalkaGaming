ID View Changelog

v004 (2019/11/06)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Requires library v003.

- Updated ID View to leverage newer capture library for working with text boxes,
  and some other internal code improvements

- Fixed bug where Event+Param (0x034) packets had NPC ID listed as the first param,
  with the actual params shifted one spot backward, and param 8 being dropped

- Fixed a bug where the default box background settings weren't being set properly.
  To fix settings made by older versions, you can either delete your settings.xml and
  ID View will regenerate a new one on next load, or you can (with ID View unloaded)
  manually edit settings.xml to move the <bg></bg> content inside the <box></box> tag

- Singularized references to colors. Users with older settings.xml will need to edit
  them and change the <colors></colors> tags to read <color></color>. (Or delete and 
  generate a new one with defaults)

- Fixed a bug where Event (0x032) packets were being listed with params despite not
  actually having any


v003 (2019/10/26)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fixed a bug where mob special spawn packets were being confused for event option packets

v002 (2019/10/23)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Requires library v002.

- ID View will now check against the loaded library at start and warn the user
  if there is a version mismatch.

- Added command //idview box_test.
  Input it to display a test box you can drag and move to become a new "base location"
  for boxes displayed by ID View. When the box is in the desired position, input the
  command again the save this new starting location.

- Added a small 0.2 wait to the auto-hide time, in attempts of mitigating the box
  disappearing during events due to event option->updates when time is set to 0.

v001 (2019/10/21)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Essentially rewrites ID View from the ground up as a "real release"

- Started to move all my capture addons over to use a unified library. At the
  moment, ID View is the first/only to use this new library system.

- A new Windower text box will display on triggered packets. This box will stay
  displayed on the screen while an event plays, so you can see/ponder params
  while characters are talking and potentially pushing the "chatlog only"
  printing out of the visible chat log. Boxes can be set to not display.
  Settings XML (see below): show_box true|false

- New settings file will be created on first load, and loaded from afterwards.
  This file has settings for colors, whether the new text box displays, where,
  whether it auto hides after an event, how many boxes to display at once, 
  and how long of a timer after an event for it to auto hide each update type

- By request, ID View can now be set to a certain mode via the //idview mode NAME command:
  OFF:     ID View stops taking action on packet triggers
  INFO:    ID View will display event information, but not write them to file
  PASSIVE: ID View will write to file, but not actively display event information ("stealth")
  ACTIVE:  ID View will both display event information, and write it to file (classic behavior)

- New commands added:
  mode: Sets the mode for ID View (see above). Usage: //idview mode passive
  color_test: Displays the colorized integers that ID View uses to colorize information with.
              You can look at the colors, then put the code into your settings XML's tags.
  ver: Spits out the current ID View version, and the date "released".
       Also spits out the current capture library version, and the version that ID View "expects".
